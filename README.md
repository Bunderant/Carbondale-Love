Carbondale Love

This is a short film written in POV-Ray for SIU Carbondale's CS485 (Computer Graphics) in spring of 2011.  Here's a link to [the video submitted for class](http://youtu.be/P_GqFaAg7TY) on YouTube, which was created from the code in the "Original Submitted Assignment" commit.  

For now, check the description on the video for some basic project details.
